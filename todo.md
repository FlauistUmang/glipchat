- icon right on header needs dynamic placement based on device type or something -- matchmedia sucks (iphone 4 needs 24px right padding or something)
- dialog will be clever about whether the invites are all for non users or any existing users
- if users exist in invite list, open the room and send invites to all parties, otherwise send invites and that's it
- active marker for active contacts
- invite marker for non-user contacts
- smart contact connecting to existing users
- show recent history for mobile contacts instead of all contacts
- excess tracker bug calls in roomstore (is calling meteor.call like 5 times!)
- batch publications

- notification collection for tracking all sorts of notifications
- getContacts should only get the updated contacts instead of all contacts -- a little bit of work here
- show contact photo in answer-overlay
- active contact tracking, subscribing shouldn't happen so often
