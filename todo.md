  - **strange STATE_IN_PROGRESS bug with joining from push**
  - **firefox testing and fixes**
  - **invite modal component broken**
  - **nav dropdown broken**
  - **revive electron**
  - **still need to reimplement invitations**
    - full screen the react-select and always open!!

    - proper invite functionality (meteorMethod -- createRoom)
    - fix or replace react-select for all its bugs
  - need to add/fix notifications
  - **make push-manifest.json private and autogenerated**
- images protected bug -- see https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files/issues/212
- interval in component for mic/vid rights gUM
- slow to create room why?
- validate all error messages
- add some settings ~ especially cordova related ones
- hide status icon until you implement that feature
- snooze notifications functionality

-  Enhance invite workflow
  - mobile -- you send an invite
    - if an active invitee opens the app after a notification and the inviter is active, they will get a dialog asking to join the room and a notification in their quasar notification list for retrieval -- which shows 'join' cta until the users leave the room
    - if you invite non-users, they will go directly to room as guest. if the room is empty, user will be directed to notifications list on mobile or homepage on desktop. ~ implement with invitation codes in email
-  Add raix push notifications for cordova to enhance mobile support
-  Add TURN server support to make it more useful for real-world deployment

**med**

- tests for all components
- figure out component tests with meteor + redux
- tests for actions
- tests for stores
- test multiple users on desktop native
- test multiple users on desktop browser
- test everything on mobile
- test everything on desktop native

- bug -- bookmark needs to be instantly selected for copying
- bug -- don't include electron in cordova builds :/
- move the contacts from google to user level so google gets less importance
